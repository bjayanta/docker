Volume

In Docker, volumes are persistent storage solutions that reside outside of a container's lifecycle. They allow data to be preserved even if the container is removed or recreated. Volumes are managed by Docker and stored on the host machine, providing a reliable way to share data between containers and persist data across container lifecycles.

The three main types of volumes are:

1. Host-Mounted volumes
2. Named volumes
3. Anonymous volumes
